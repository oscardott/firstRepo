    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">
        My name is <span style="color:rgb(219, 152, 52);">Oscar</span>, and my experience in college so far has been good. 
        I'm happy to be in the communication design major after struggling to decide what I wanted to pursue. 
        Discovering the path of illustration at this school has really inspired me. 
        I've gotten passing grades, and I feel that my creative skills are developing, which I am grateful for. 
        Overall, my college experience is going well, and I hope it stays that way.

        A quote that I like is an excerpt from a poem written in 1717 by Alexander Pope. I learned of it from the film <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, which is one that I really enjoyed.

    <!--Poem Excerpt-->
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 50px;">
        How happy is the blameless vestal’s lot!<br>
        The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br>
        Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br>
        Each pray’r accepted, and each wish resign’d.
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 150px;">—Alexander Pope, <cite>Eloisa to Abelard</cite></p>
